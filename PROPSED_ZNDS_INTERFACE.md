# Proposed ZDNS Interface 

The interface defined below exposes the ZDNS library to the modules and other programs that wish to use it.

This also assumes that the caching interface will remain nearly the same, so those interfaces have been omitted for brevity.

There will be some additional structure around how modules are created and registered in the

Finally, The global and routine LookupFactories may not be necessary anymore. I believe that we

type IsCached bool
type IsTraced bool

type Response struct {
    Result zdns.Result

type Question struct {
    // The DNS type to query for
	Type        uint16
    // The class to query for

	Name        string
    // The nameserver to use. Leave blank for default (system?) resolver
    Nameserver  string
    // Set an ID to associate distinct queries together, for easier aggregation
    // ID will be passed along through the answer.
    Id          UUID
